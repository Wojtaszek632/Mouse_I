## General info
First version of path finding robot, controlled by [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3?queryID=undefined) board. It usues the [HC-SR04](https://www.sainsmart.com/products/ultrasonic-ranging-detector-mod-hc-sr04-distance-sensor) ultrasonic sensor to detect and awoid obstacles and an [L293D](https://www.amazon.com/NDRTJM-MSTL2930-L293D-Stepper-Driver/dp/B008XCGLNM) push-pull driver to controll 2 Brushed DC electric motors.

## Technologies
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
## Parts needed
* Arduino Uno
* L293D push-pull 2 channel motor driver
* HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
* Breadboard
* Breadboard jumper wires
* 2WD Robot Car Chassis
* Battery pack or other energy source. (I use 4x AA batteries to power motors, and 9V battery to power Arduino, sensor, and logic of the L293D)

## Setup
Upload MARK_I.ino to your arduino and connect components as shown below:

## Features
Thanks to HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, this robot can:
* Measure distance to a obstacle
* Avoid obstacles
* Escape complicated mazes

## Status
This particular configuration is finished, hower i plan on using it as a base for future verisons of the Mouse.

## Inspiration
Youtube videos, Forbot blog.
